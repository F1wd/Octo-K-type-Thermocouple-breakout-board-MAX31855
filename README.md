Octo K-type Thermocouple breakout board MAX31855 Review

You could accomplish the same thing with 3 mortys and a jumper cable.
wasn't able to get the diagnistic function to operate properly,.. should throw code 3 as I only have one thermocouple
but it throws code 1 or 0 alot,... anyway i still may have some spi cs issues to work out but we will see.
